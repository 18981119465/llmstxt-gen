# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a new project repository named `llmstxt-gen` that appears to be in the initial setup phase. The repository currently contains only:
- MIT License file
- Python-focused .gitignore file

## Technology Stack

Based on the .gitignore file, this project is expected to use:
- Python as the primary programming language
- Standard Python packaging tools (potentially pip, poetry, pdm, or uv)
- Common Python development tools (pytest, mypy, ruff)

## Development Setup

Since this is a new project, you'll need to:
1. Initialize the project structure based on the intended use case
2. Set up the Python environment and dependencies
3. Configure development tools as needed

## Notes

- The project name suggests it may be related to generating LLMs.txt files or similar text processing functionality
- No existing codebase, package.json, or configuration files exist yet
- Follow Python best practices when implementing new features
- The .gitignore file suggests this will be a Python project with modern tooling
